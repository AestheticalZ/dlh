# Discord Link Helper (DLH)
Discord Link Helper is basically the Discord GIF Favourites tab, on steroids, and with awful code.

Well, let me tell you, I have an excuse for the code being ass. This was the first time I worked with ListViews and this kind of stuff.

MIT licensed, cuz, why not?

## Compiling
You will need:
* Visual Studio 2019

Compilation from there should be straightforward.
